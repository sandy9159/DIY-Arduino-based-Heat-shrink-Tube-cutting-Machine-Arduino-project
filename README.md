Hey guys this time I have made a heat shrink tube cutting machine, heat shrinks are frequently needed in small length, manually cutting them is to boring job so I build this mini machine it can cut heat shrink from 2mm to 8mm in any length and quantity, user just have to insert data from HMI and need to press start so this machine automatically start cutting heat shrink tube.

Component used in this project.
1. Custom PCB 
2. Arduino Nano
3. A4988 Stepper driver
4. High torque stepper motor
5. Nema 17 stepper motor 
6. some ball joint rod
7. 8mm smooth rod
8. SC8UU linear bearing
